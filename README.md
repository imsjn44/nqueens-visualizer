# N-Queens Visualizer

This is a React-based visualization tool for the N-Queens problem, built using Vite. The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## 🚀 Features
- **Live Visualization**: Watch the backtracking algorithm solve the N-Queens problem step by step.
- **Dynamic Board**: The chessboard updates dynamically as the solution progresses.
- **Built with React + Vite**: Fast and lightweight frontend performance.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nqueens-visualizer.git
cd nqueens-visualizer
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```
Then open **`http://localhost:5173/`** in your browser.

## 📌 How It Works
- The algorithm uses **backtracking** to place queens on the board.
- The visualization updates every 500ms to show the step-by-step solution.
- A queen (`♛`) is placed only if it is safe (i.e., no other queen attacks it).

## 📸 Screenshots
(Include screenshots of the visualization in action)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React**: Component-based UI
- **Vite**: Fast build tool
- **CSS**: Styling for the board and UI
